# Style-Transfer-using-VGG-16-Model

Implementing Neural Style Transfer in Tensorflow by using the pre-trained VGG 16 model. Follow the IPython Notebook for the code and explanations.

## References
    
The VGG 16 model is loaded from a script taken from [here](https://github.com/pkmital/CADL/blob/master/session-4/libs/vgg16.py).

The majority of this code is taken from the [TensorFlow-Tutorials](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials). I highly recommend them to those who want to get started with TensorFlow.
